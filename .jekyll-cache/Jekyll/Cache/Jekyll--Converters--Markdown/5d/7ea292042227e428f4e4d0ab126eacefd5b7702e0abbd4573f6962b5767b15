<p>Cloud computing has as many applications as there are algorithms (ie: lots).  However at the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre we are tasked with supporting researchers in Australia to solve complex problems with computational facilities. Using Nimbus can help you scale your problems and make them solvable in a reasonable timeframe.  Is it “Supercomputing”?  We generally reserve such terms to describe our peak computing facilities.  At Pawsey our peak computer is Magnus, a 36000 core Cray XC-30.  It is intended for very large, parallelized workflows that have been specifically designed to run optimally on such hardware.</p>

<p>The horizontal scalability here is different from vertical scalability.  Imagine a process that runs on a single compute core;  You could achieve horizontal scalability by running 100 instances of this algorithm, of course that might be a lot to manage.  There would be many input files and many output files; you might need to combine these outputs at some point.  An equivalent process tackled with vertical scalability would mean running a single algorithm on 100 cores.  This might result in an algorithm that runs 100 times faster (it also might not do so; parallel programming is hard).</p>

<p>At Pawsey Supercomputing Centre we operate a range of computing facilities for a range of computational workflows. Nimbus is well suited to a range of problems in the area of smaller scale problems and horizontally scaled problems.</p>

<p>There are (at least) four general groups of researcher use cases that fit well onto a system like Nimbus.</p>

<h4 id="1-scaling-up-to-hpc">1. Scaling up to HPC</h4>
<p>The application process for getting access to Supercomputing can be quite demanding.  You need establish to the review committee that you can run your algorithm(s) at scale.  You can use Nimbus to develop and refine your parallel workflows and use this work to provide evidence of your experience.</p>

<h4 id="2-the-long-tail">2. The long tail…</h4>
<p>We understand that there is great variety in research needs and algorithms.  Most HPC facilities manage access through limited wall time queues.  Usually your compute jobs will be limited to 24 hours before they are killed.  On Nimbus you can run jobs with unlimited execution time (well, as long as your virtual machine is running).  This may be important to you if it is hard to modify your algorithm to allow for terminating processing.</p>

<h4 id="3-complex-data-workflows">3. Complex data workflows</h4>
<p>As technologies like the Internet of Things (IOT) and various data capture tools become more common, you may be collecting large numbers of various files.  If you then need to write algorithms to sort through this data and analyse it, you may end up with some IO-bound workflows that are not good use of HPC machines.  HPC facilities are intended for compute bound operations.</p>

<h4 id="4-clusters-in-the-cloud">4. Clusters in the Cloud</h4>
<p>You may need to perform analysis with tools like Hadoop or Apache Spark.  With Nimbus you have access to cluster management tools that allow for growing your cluster elastically and controlling the specifics of the cluster deployment.</p>
