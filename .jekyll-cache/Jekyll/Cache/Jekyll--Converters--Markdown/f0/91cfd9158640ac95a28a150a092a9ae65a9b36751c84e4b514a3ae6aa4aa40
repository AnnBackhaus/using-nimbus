<p>There are many types and flavours of Linux distribution. The most widely used are often the Debian based linux distributions such as Ubuntu, and the Red Hat/Fedora based distribution such as CentOS. Other distributions have different methods to do updates that will not be covered for the purpose of this training.</p>

<p>All modern Linux distribution do not allow the superuser (root) to connect directly to perform administrative tasks. What is used is a “service” user that does not have administrative permissions, but that can access those privileges by executing the command “sudo” before administrative like commands.</p>

<h2 id="use-these-commands-as-often-as-possible">Use these commands as often as possible!</h2>

<p>Ideally, combine these commands, depending on your Linux distribution, and run them at least once a week, or every time you login.</p>

<p>This will keep your instance up to date.</p>
