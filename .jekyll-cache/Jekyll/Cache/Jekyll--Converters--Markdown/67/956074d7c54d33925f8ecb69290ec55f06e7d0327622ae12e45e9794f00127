<p>There are many types and flavours of Linux distribution. The most widely used are often the Debian based linux distributions such as Ubuntu, and the Red Hat/Fedora based distribution such as CentOS. Other distributions have different methods to do updates that will not be covered for the purpose of this training.</p>

<p>All modern Linux distribution do not allow the superuser (root) to connect directly to perform administrative tasks. What is used is a “service” user that does not have administrative permissions, but that can access those privileges by executing the command “sudo” before administrative like commands.</p>

<p>To install new software:</p>

<h2 id="use-these-commands-as-often-as-possible">Use these commands as often as possible!</h2>

<p>Ideally, combine these commands, depending on your Linux distribution, and run them at least once a week, or every time you login.</p>

<p>This will keep your instance up to date.</p>

<h2 id="package-managers">Package managers</h2>

<p>Package managers are a collection of software tools that automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer’s operating system in a consistent manner.</p>

<p>Package managers are designed to eliminate the need for manual installs and updates. There are a range of different package managers available for different operating systems, as well as those for specific languages that work across different systems, such as the conda package manager for Python.</p>

<p>To install new software on Ubuntu you use apt:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo  apt-get  install &lt;package_name&gt;</code></td>
      <td>Install packages available within your selected Linux distribution’s software package repository</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>To install new software on CentOS you use yum:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo  yum install &lt;package_name&gt;</code></td>
      <td>Install packages available within your selected Linux distribution’s software package repository</td>
    </tr>
