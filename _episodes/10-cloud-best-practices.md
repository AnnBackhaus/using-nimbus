## Best practices
1. **Snapshot your instance!**

    This saves your Root Disk and allows you to launch a fully configured instance with all packages already installed

2. **Document your steps so you know what you did**

    Create a configuration script, save a copy out of the cloud and keep it up to date
    history -> prints all previous commands
    history  |  keyword -> searches a specific command

3. **Update! Every time you login!**

    ```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get update```-> updates packages and security
    Older versions of packages and operating systems eventually lose support from their creators

4.  **Be Green and keep it elastic**

    The cloud still uses electricity and is shared, when youâ€™re no longer using it -> turn it off!

## Ideas for using your VM
Once you have your shiny new VM, you are now the master of your own destiny.  You have flexibility to download software to start doing science.  Listed below are some tips on installing some common software packages that you might like to use however "Googling" your linux flavour / version along with the software will often give you success.  Also listed as details on moving data to your instance


**Conda**

Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system.   that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads, and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs but it can package and distribute software for any language.

You can get started by downloading the installer suitable for your instance.  Miniconda installer page is given here [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

Further information on installation here [Linux installation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html)


**R**

You can install R or Rstudio easily for most Linux flavours

for Debian/Ubuntu run *sudo apt-get install r-base* and or Fedora run *sudo yum install R* then type *R* to run

RStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that makes R easier to use.  Go to RStudio download page - [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/) and enter the following for Ubuntu

- *sudo apt-get install gdebi-core*
- *wget https://download2.rstudio.org/server/trusty/amd64/rstudio-server-1.2.1335-amd64.deb*
- *sudo gdebi rstudio-server-1.2.1335-amd64.deb*


**Machine learning**

If you are interested in machine learning the following site has many good resources (from beginner to advanced) [https://towardsdatascience.com/](https://towardsdatascience.com/)

## Applying for a VM
Compared to applying for time on one of our supercomputers, the process for applying for an allocation on Nimbus is less demanding.  You can apply at any time of the year by visiting the link below
