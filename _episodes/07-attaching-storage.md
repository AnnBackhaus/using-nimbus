**There are two types of built-in storage**
1. Root Disk- your home directory, and storage for the operating system of your virtual machine
2. Volume Storage - a 2nd hard disk you can add to your VM for working storage

Volumes are created, attached using the Nimbus interface, and then formatted and mounted
## First create a volume
Go to "Compute" then "Volumes".  Click on "Create Volume".  A pop-up will appear (see screenshot below).  There is no need to enter any information (unless you want to) in the pop-up, just click "Create Volume" button again at the bottom of the window.

![Nimbus Volumes]({{ page.root }}/fig/Nimbus_volumes.png)

![Nimbus Create Volumes]({{ page.root }}/fig/nimbus_create_volume.png)



## Now, manage attachements.
![Nimbus Configure Volumes]({{ page.root }}/fig/Nimbus_configure_volumes.png)

Select the "Manage Attachments" from the drop-down menu of the volume you just created

![Nimbus Manage Attachments]({{ page.root }}/fig/nimbus_vol_manage_attachments.png)

We can check that the volume is attached, but we can’t use it just yet.  If the unformatted disk is properly attached you should see (from the fdisk command):

~~~
root@test-instance:~# sudo fdisk -l /dev/vdc
Disk /dev/vdc: 20 GiB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
~~~

First we need to format the disk.  We will do this using the mkfs command. __Warning: Use mkfs only once for each volume. It wipes any data already on it.__

~~~
root@test-instance:~# sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc
mke2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
Creating filesystem with 5242880 4k blocks and 1310720 inodes

Finally we can mount the disk:

~~~
root@test-instance:~# sudo mkdir /data
root@test-instance:~# sudo mount /dev/vdc /data
root@test-instance:~# df -h | grep vdc
/dev/vdc         20G   44M   19G   1% /data
